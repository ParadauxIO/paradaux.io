                I really enjoy working on these posts &mdash; They're an expression of
                my own thoughts, feelings and opinions, not those of my employers.
                I will be trying to post once per month going forward at least, but we'll
                see how I do. 
            </p>

                This blogging platform is built upon Gatsby 5, I will probably open source
                it at some point, I still have a lot of stuff to fix up before that point.
