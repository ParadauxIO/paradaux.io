I don't think I'm alone in thinking that 'cryptobros' are a plight against our industry. They are coopting existing technologies as theirs
and presenting cryptocurrencies, NFTs and the like as something much more than they are. I am probably one of the biggest crypto 'Web 3.0' skeptics out there.
I flat out refuse to believe that blockchain and things built on similar principles are the way forward for technology. Every personality in the space I have seen 
thus far is out to make a quick buck, either selling shovels during a gold rush or are completely illusioned by what the technology is capable of.

The more embarassing thing I can see is my own home university is home to some of these people, and are pouring funding into this, a climate-destroying technology
in lieu of funding Climate-tech or actually useful innovation in computer science, something I don't think I'll forgive them for when they inevitably ring me up
to donate after graduation &mdash; Although none of this is the topic of today's discussion.

This whole article has been sparked by a decent development among students and student life for Trinity students. There's a collective attempting to found a student 
society based entirely on crypto &ndash; not cryptography, cryptocurrencies and related technology (*read: scams.*) I sincerely doubt that these students aren't interested
in the technology behind it, otherwise they'd pitch doing events based on it to pre-existing technology societies; Netsoc and DUCSS. 

It seems to me these students are out to make a quick few quid, and promote the speculative trading of cryptocurrencies and 'non fungible tokens.' Thankfully, I can't
imagine the Central Societies Committee ever approving it, despite how useless they ordinarily are, being run by students from the larger societies. It's an organisation
with a track record for subverting their own constitution and rules on the regular. 

I fully intend to vote against its recognition at the AGM, in my capacity as Treasurer of Netsoc, should they scrounge up the 200 signatories required to propose it.

&lt;/rant&gt;
