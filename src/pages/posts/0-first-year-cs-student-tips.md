The IT Industry is a weird one, It is so wide-encompassing with so many avenues to pursue, and often the visible way to land yourself solidly within it is to take up a degree in Computer Science, which is the academic backbone of the industry. 

The thing is, though, it's also a field that attracts people from all sorts of backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses and education. You don't actually need a degree to succeed — It just makes it an awful lot easier to. 

### 1. Computer Science isn't for the nerdy kids. 

Computer Science is one of those fields that has a bit of a stigma around it that only the bright, nerdy kids can succeed. That's not true. In fact, now more than ever we need people with a computer science background in roles that aren't academia or programming. 

If you don't fit into the stereotype that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it, or that you won't do very well, the industry has opened up so much to everyone and anyone with a passion for technology.

If you're not sure about computer science, you could enrol yourself in [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0), a free massively open online course (MOOC) by Harvard which is a well-made pre-computer-science course which I took myself in my first year to reground myself in the basics. 

### 2. You don't need to be a computer whizz-kid, or a programming aficionado by September 1st of your first year. 

In fact, for a lot of CS students programming doesn't really 'click' until late in the second or even third year of a four-year program, and for others it mightn't at all (Which I'll get to later.) There will be some who do have this experience coming into University, and they will show off (I myself was guilty of this) but you need to ignore them, you're on your own journey, and you have plenty of time to catch up and even exceed their abilities as you progress. 
  
### 3. Becoming a lecturer or a Software Developer aren't the only outcomes of a CS Degree

In fact, the entire industry is yearning for more people with a technical background in general, this includes leadership roles such as Program/Product management and Software Engineering management as well as sales, marketing and basically anything you can imagine. Basically every field could use someone with a computer science background right now, it's an amazing stepping stone into doing a Masters or getting into a Ph.D. program in an entirely other field. 

We're among the most sought-after graduates, regardless of any advances in AI might have you believe. 
  
### 4. You don't need the fastest computer or laptop to be a computer scientist

You don't want to be the person lugging a 4 kg gaming monstrosity into a lecture hall with fans like a jet turbine. Keep that power for your tower at home, if you even need it at all. Get yourself a decent build-quality generalist computer, get yourself a solid CPU, at least 8 GB of RAM and a battery life that can last 7+ hours to get you through a day of lectures where there might potentially be no sockets in sight. 

The kinds of software you'll be running won't be too intensive, you can even try running some common integrated development environments (IDEs) on what you have currently to see if it'll last you your first few years. This does vary by speciality, though. Doing a lot of 3D modelling/CAD or basic AI and you might want a discrete graphics card, but frankly you won't be touching most of these topics until your 3rd or 4th year, where you might be better off flipping your then 2-plus-year-old machine and upgrading. 

I'd also recommend getting a solid screen and keyboard, if you can check out laptops of your choosing at a local hardware store then do it, just don't buy the machines then and there — Take the model numbers and look online for reviews and to see if there's a better deal online. 

### 3. The language doesn't matter

Don't get hung up on whatever programming language your intro to programming module uses, you're not really learning the programming language, you're learning how to program — Two completely different tasks. You should try and learn the language through which you're learning to program, but don't worry too much about the syntax/semantics of that particular language; just try and get your head around what's going on. Being able to read code and more or less understand it regardless of the language is an invaluable skill.

### 4. Work on things out of class, and outside the curriculum 

The best way to learn to program, and to get better at Computer Science is to apply it to what you already love, build a website to show your love for your favourite sports team, or write a tool that'll help gamers in your favourite video game. Do whatever it takes to make use of your newly acquired skills in something practical.

All too often, university programs don't show you the practical implications of what you're learning and focus too much on the theory. If you want to really get the theory and to have a bit of fun with what you're learning, then take a step (or leap!) outside the curriculum and get your hands dirty with code. 

### 5. Learn Git. 

No seriously, and try and do it from the command line rather than relying too much on the Git integrations now available in your favourite IDEs or code editors. Try and understand what's going on with Git when you run each command, being able to manage your code effectively and to be able to roll back changes and collaborate will help you early on, don't wait for your university to introduce the topic to you, it's possible they never will — or they'll only do so in a very basic way. 

### 6. Check out the Missing Semester

Much in the same vein as CS50, take all the courses in the "[Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)" series in your first year, it covers a bunch of topics broadly that will help you become a better all-rounded developer. The same comes from the fact that it's a semester of topics that all CS programs should teach, but often don't. This is the case for my alma mater, Trinity College, Dublin. 

I hope some of these were food for thought at the very least, if you have anything to add or any criticisms to make I'd love to hear them, my contact details are available here on my website. I'd love to hear from you.
