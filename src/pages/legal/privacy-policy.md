## Foreword

This is a personal blog (the 'Blog') run by Rían Errity (the 'Author'), an unincorperated individual. It is not run for profit but as a means to share ideas, tutorials and concepts as well as to serve as a landing page for projects. Data harvesting is not a purpose however as certain information is required to run the service, as well as additional information used to guage interest (i.e., Analytics) certain information is indeed collected by this website which is governed by this policy.

## Information collected.

No personal data or personally identifiable information is collected and stored besides what is necessary to provide the service. This largely concerns IP addresses which are logged by our data processor and hosting provider, Cloudflare, to provide the service and to prevent abuse. This use falls under necessity.

As well as IP addresses we also collect anonymised analytics. This works by using a rolling session ID which changes
automatically every 15 minutes as you use the service, each 15 minute period is considered a unique session and this is 
not tied to your personal information at any point. 

Alongside these session ids we collect the following information
- **User Agent**, a string provided by your browser which contains your operating system, browser version and other non-identifiable information. 
- **Visited Pages**, what pages you visit on the website.

These are used for insights to track what articles or pages are most popular to improve the content. These insights will
never be provided to a third party outside our data processors.

## Data Processors

- **Supabase**: Used to store analytics information, it is a Backend-as-a-Service which hosts our Postgres Database. See: https://supabase.com/privacy
 
Information is transferred to these services in order to provide the service, and to provide analytics. Data is kept in the EU, Ireland in the case of
Supabase.
