The personal website of RÃ­an Errity, a blogging platform built in [React](https://reactjs.org) on top of [Supabase](https://supabase.com). It is intended this will be made available as a template from which you will be able to build your own similar platform, but with your own theme and content, keeping the simple blog content management system intact. 

More details to follow on the exact implementation.
